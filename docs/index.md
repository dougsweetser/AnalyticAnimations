## Space-time numbers

The numbers we are taught are docile: the juggler has three balls and will
always have these three, an eternal truth. We need numbers that can describe
the balls in motion in space-time. In analytic geometry, time is formally
turned into space to form a tragetory graph. The idea of space-time numbers is
that one gets the actual tragetory as an animation.

The design of space-time numbers comes from thinking about theoretical physics,
not what is convenient. One deep message from physics is that group theory
should be there at the foundation. The group needed for space-time is called
the Quaternion Group Q8. There are eight sets of positive numbers, one for the
past/the future, left/right, up/down, and near/far.

Let's confess from the start, space-time numbers are strange. _So one could
have a positive past and future???_ Yup. _But why not just subtract the two and
see who is bigger and call that one the winner?_ That certainly is one of the
most common things that will be done. It is a way of creating equivalence
classes, 2-0 is equivalent to 7-5. Yet it is also true that the 7-5 must have
had a different history from 2-0. 

Things happen in physics which to this day appear strange. In this repo, we
start with strange space-time numbers and see if it helps us at all to
understand physics in a new way.
